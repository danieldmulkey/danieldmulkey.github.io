title:  "Snel's law is actually interesting"
---

Anyone who took an introductory physics or optics class learned about Snell's law:
\begin{equation*}
n_1\sin{\theta_1} = n_2\sin{\theta_2}
\end{equation*}
Apparently, it's actually Snel's law, but history aside, this is often reduced to
"angle of incidence equals angle of reflection." I recently saw a Physics StackExchange
question where someone was asking where this comes from. There were plenty of
quantum or E&M answers, but no one giving the simple version, nor the
(No: Intro snel's as first simple thing. Plot twist on spelling.)

(Instead: Someone on the physics stack exchange was asking where angle in == angle out comes from...)

(People always jump to angle in = angle out. Can't forget index.)

(hand wave, if you have a layout like *this*, then index changes, so angle does)

(Step further, eigenpolarization reflections from inside biaxial crystal)

(So here's a friendly reminder to always watch your angles and polarizations when dealing with birefringent materials).
