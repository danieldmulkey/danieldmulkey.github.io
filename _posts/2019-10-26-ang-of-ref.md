title:  "Angle of reflection"
---
I recently saw a Physics StackExchange question where someone was asking where
"angle of incidence equals angle of reflection" comes from. There were plenty
of complicated quantum answers, but there's a straightforward and surprisingly
interesting explanation. All it comes down to is phasematching. Equivalently,
boundary conditions at the interface between the two media.

(hand wave, if you have a layout like *this*, then index changes, so angle does)

(Step further, eigenpolarization reflections from inside biaxial crystal)

(So here's a friendly reminder to always watch your angles and polarizations when dealing with birefringent materials).
